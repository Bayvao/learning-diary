## Text Analysis

### Tokenization
Break the text into words.

### TF-IDF

### Lemmatization
Find the basic form of each word variation in the context. Examples are "account" from "accounts" and "break" from "broke."

### Stop Words
Stop Word Filter: Filter out common words. In English, there are hundreds of stop words like "a," "my," and "on," to name a few, that have little bearing on relevance or meaning, and thus can safely be removed from the query in order to target the more valuable words.

### Part of Speech (PoS) 
Part of Speech (PoS) Filter: Read through text and give each word a PoS based on the context. There are nine parts in English: adjective, adverb, conjunction, determiner, noun, number, preposition, pronoun, and verb. We only capture nouns, verbs, proper nouns, and adjectives, as they together represent the purpose of a text.
